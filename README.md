This e-commerce website is built using Django, Bootstrap, Django REST framework, JavaScript, HTML, and MySQL, with a user authentication feature. Users can view the product list, add products to their cart and favorites list, and review their selections. If users add products to their cart and favorites, these items are stored in MySQL and PhpMyAdmin and can be viewed by me (the developer).
